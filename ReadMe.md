# Pipeline for Brittle Star Project 1
	-  Morphological Data collected by Tania Pineda-Enrique
	-  Genomic data and phylogeny made by collaborators in Australia?
	
## PART I: Ancestral state reconstructions (already done using Mesquite)
	- Data used: Tree and morphological characters
	
## PART II:  Divergence times estimation (cannot be done until we get the alignments)
### Aim 1: Determining relationships among living species, so branch lengths can be transformed using either a) strict or b) relaxed clock model.
	 
	 - Data needed: Molecular sequence data (so we only get relative ages-since no geolofical info is provided)
         - Ask Tania's Collaborators for their molecular seq alignments they used for the tree( that was built in BEAST?
### Aim 2: Using fossil records to calibrate absolute times a) node dating b) fossilized birth death process
### Aim 3: Total evidence dating (requires fossil information -ask Tania if she has it)


# Pipeline for Brittle Star Project 2 (Species Complex)
## Data collected: Morphological character data and COI, ITS and 16S)
       - Made gene trees using RAxML
       - Made species tree(concatenated alignments/supermatrix) using RAxML
       - Need to do Species Delimitation
       
       
From Tania:
The Tree information I have is for all the phylogenomic data (which I dont have any sequences) all I have is the morphological matrix and the molecular tree. So that is one project, the one I'm doing the ancestral reconstruction.
The second project is the one of the species complex, which I have the sequences, and the one I need to do the species delimitation methods etc ..

so the one I'm doing the ancestral reconstruction is with all the morphological data I have, I'm looking at those characters in the molecular tree (the  phylogenomic data). Which is all I have for the moment. 

The species complex or cryptic diversity is my second project which includes a single species, which are multiple species. The data that I'm working with three different genes (COI, 16s and ITS), the reason I need to do the delimitation analysis. This data I have everything
