# Pipeline for Brittle Star Ancestral state reconstructions
	-  Morphological Data collected by Tania Pineda-Enrique
	-  Genomic data and phylogeny made by collaborators in Australia?



## PART I: Ancestral state reconstructions done using RevBayes
	- Data used:
	- Assumptions:
	- Scripts:



## PART II:  Divergence times estimation using RevBayes (cannot be done until we get the alignments)
### Aim 1: Determining relationships among living species, so branch lengths can be transformed using either a) strict or b) relaxed clock model.
	 
	 - Data needed: Molecular sequence data (so we only get relative ages-since no geolofical info is provided)
         - Ask Tania's Collaborators for their molecular seq alignments they used for the tree( that was built in BEAST?)
	
### Aim 2: Using fossil records to calibrate absolute times a) node dating b) fossilized birth death process
### Aim 3: Total evidence dating (requires fossil information -ask Tania if she has it)
