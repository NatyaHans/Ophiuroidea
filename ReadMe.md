# Pipeline for Brittle Star Project 1
	-  Morphological Data collected by Tania Pineda-Enrique
	-  Genomic data and phylogeny made by collaborators in Australia?
	
## PART I: Ancestral state reconstructions (already done using Mesquite)
	- Data used: Tree and morphological characters
	- Done using Mesquite (by Tania)
	- Done using RevBayes (by Natya)-ongoing 
	

> ## PART II:  Divergence times estimation (cannot be done until we get the alignments)
> ### Aim 1: Determining relationships among living species, so branch lengths can be transformed using either a) strict or b) relaxed clock model.
	 
	 - Data needed: Molecular sequence data (so we only get relative ages-since no geolofical info is provided)
         - Ask Tania's Collaborators for their molecular seq alignments they used for the tree( that was built in BEAST?
> ### Aim 2: Using fossil records to calibrate absolute times a) node dating b) fossilized birth death process
> ### Aim 3: Total evidence dating (requires fossil information -ask Tania if she has it)


> # Pipeline for Brittle Star Project 2 (Species Complex)
> ## Data collected: Morphological character data and COI, ITS and 16S)
       - Made gene trees using RAxML
       - Made species tree(concatenated alignments/supermatrix) using RAxML
       - Need to do Species Delimitation : ABGD and GMYC
