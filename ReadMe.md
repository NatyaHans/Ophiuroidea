# Pipeline for Brittle Star Ancestral state reconstructions
	-  Morphological Data collected by Tania Pineda-Enrique
	-  Genomic data and phylogeny made by collaborators in Australia?

## Divergence times estimation using RevBayes
Aim 1: Determining relationships among living species, so branch lengths can be transformed using either a) strict or b) relaxed clock model. 
	- Data used: Molecular sequence data (so we only get relative ages-since no geolofical info is provided)
	- Assumptions:
	- Scripts:
	
Aim 2: Using fossil records to calibrate absolute times a) node dating b) fossilized birth death process
       - 

Aim 3: Total evidence dating (requires fossil information -ask Tania if she has it)
